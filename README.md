# OpenStack-ConoHa
OpenStack based DotNet SDK for ConoHa 

# Note
1. this is not an official SDK of [ConoHa by GMO](http://conoha.jp/) but a fan-made version. 
2. some operations like creating a new virtual machine instance would cause the extra charge, ride at your own risk.
3. the usage of this SDK will be updated sooner or later.

# And I think,
" enterprises will realize they want to run their own private clouds. once organizations start spending a few hundred thousand dollars a month on Amazon, they'll look at OpenStack."
